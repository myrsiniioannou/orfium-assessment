# Orfium Hiring Assessment Submission

This repository contains my solutions for the **Orfium hiring assessment**, covering two tasks:

## 1. Full Implementation of the Text Normalization Task
- A **complete implementation** of the text normalization assessment.
- The solution processes **raw composition writer information**, extracting and standardizing names while removing redundant or irrelevant data.
- It combines **rule-based techniques and NLP-based entity recognition** (using SpaCy) for optimal accuracy.
- Includes **evaluation metrics, visualizations, and further optimizations** to ensure robustness.

## 2. Detailed Approach for Cover Song Similarity
- A **structured and comprehensive methodology** to address the **cover song similarity** problem using the **Da-TACOS dataset**.
- The approach describes:
  - **Feature selection** from the datasetâ€™s **pre-extracted musical features** (e.g., chroma, hpcp, mfcc).
  - **Similarity metric design** to quantify relationships between original songs and their covers.
  - **Evaluation techniques** to measure performance.
- The document also includes **future recommendations** for improving and scaling the solution.

This repository serves as my **submission for the Orfium hiring assessment**, showcasing expertise in **NLP, music data analysis, and machine learning**.
